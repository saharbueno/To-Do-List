# To-Do-List

## Description
A site where the user can add new to-do list entries which have a title, category, and description. These entries can then be checked as completed or incomplete and are sorted by their respective categories. The user can choose if they want to see all entries or only those from a specific category. This website was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Takeaways 
This was my first time working with HTML forms with JS and it was definitely a challenge to be able to organize everything and make sure all information is going and staying in the right place! It was also difficult to deal with sorting entries into the complete or incomplete category since some entries can have the same general category but will be different in terms of completeness. What I liked the most was being able to make something that is useful for everyday life and something everyone can use easily.
